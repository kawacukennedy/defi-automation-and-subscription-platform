## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Prefer `const` over `let`, arrow functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### React Components
```typescript
// Good
interface Props {
  userId: string;
  onUpdate: (user: User) => void;
}

export default function UserProfile({ userId, onUpdate }: Props) {
  // Component logic
}

// Avoid
function userprofile(props) {
  // Component logic
}
```

#### API Design
- Use RESTful conventions
- Include proper error handling
- Add input validation
- Document endpoints in [API.md](API.md)

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Testing
- `chore`: Maintenance

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add wallet authentication
fix(api): resolve workflow creation bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Branch Naming
